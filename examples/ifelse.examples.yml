#to try this example, copy this file into the /src/templates folder, and
#execute it with 'tgen exec ifelse.examples'
#in this example we are going to use only the 'logic' and 'log' plugins
use:
  - 'logic'
  - 'log'
#we make an if statement and evaluate two things: true and false
if:
  #we make arrays for each of our conditions
  - 'true':
      #make sure it as an extra indentation
      log:
        info:
          - 'We are logging from here because the condition is true!'
  - 'false':
      log:
        warning:
          - "It shouldn't log from here, if it does, open an issue!"
#now we are going to make an else statement for both
else:
  - log:
      warning:
        - "It shouldn't log from here, if it does, open an issue!"
  - log:
      info:
        - 'We are logging from here because the last condition is false!'
